         populated by HTTP probe which enforced RoE at probe time, so the
         partial-recon re-filter just acts as a defensive sanity check.

    2. **Domain mode** (default): ``requested_domain`` is one root or a list
       of roots. Accept the host if it is a subdomain of any of them, or if it
       equals a root whose apex is included. ``include_root_domain`` is either
