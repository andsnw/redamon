"""Tenant isolation for the queries multi-root partial recon added or rewrote.

A node's natural key (a Domain name, a Subdomain name, a BaseURL) is NOT unique
across projects: uniqueness is (key, user_id, project_id). A query that anchors
on a labelled node without the tenant pair reads or writes another project's
graph - and a multi-root run, which matches many Domain names at once, would do
it for every root. So every MATCH / OPTIONAL MATCH / MERGE whose first node
carries an entity label must also carry user_id and project_id. A node reached
through a relationship from a scoped anchor, or a bare variable bound earlier,
is already inside the tenant.

Source-level on purpose: the partial builders and writers run against Neo4j,
which the unit gate does not have. The last test proves the scan catches a
violation, so a green run is not vacuous.
