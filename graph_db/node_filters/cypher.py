"""The only place node-filter Cypher is assembled.

A label and a property name cannot be Cypher parameters, so they are
interpolated, and ONLY from the checked catalog: each one is re-checked against
`^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$` here as well, and backquoted. Everything that came
from an operator or a scanner (selector values, rule values, keys, the paging
cursor, the time bound) travels as a parameter. A rule's `field` is resolved in
Python and never appears in a query at all.

None of these queries writes `updated_at`. Prune freshness, the triage publish
check (a string equality on `updated_at`) and the unseen badges all read it, so
a mute must not look like a scanner write.
