"""What stops a rule muting a finding, projected once and re-checked on write.

Guards only ever BLOCK muting. A guarded node's target state is "not
rule-muted", so a finding that became guarded while a rule had it muted (a
person judged it, the agent proved it) is released at the next sweep instead
of staying hidden for good. `set_human_verdict`, `apply_triage_scores` and the
agent's CONFIRMS writer all match muted nodes, so that can happen.

An operator's own mute is a separate case: it is neither muted nor unmuted by a
rule, ever. That is decided from `muted` / `muted_by`, not here.
