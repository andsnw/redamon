"""Remove every mute a node-filter RULE applied. For reverting the feature.

A rule mute is the `:Muted` label plus `muted`, `muted_at`, `muted_by` and
`muted_reason`, with `muted_by` starting `rule:`. This removes exactly those,
so the findings come back everywhere. An operator's own mute (any other
`muted_by`) is never touched, and neither is a verdict.

  # what it would do, per project, changing nothing
  python tooling/scripts/node_filters_rollback.py --all --dry-run

  # one project
  python tooling/scripts/node_filters_rollback.py --project <project id>

  # every project
  python tooling/scripts/node_filters_rollback.py --all

Idempotent: a second run finds nothing to do. It leaves the three Postgres
tables (project_node_filters, node_filter_runs, node_filter_exemptions) alone;
a `db push` of a schema without them drops them, so export them first.

Reads NEO4J_URI, NEO4J_USER and NEO4J_PASSWORD, like every other graph tool.
